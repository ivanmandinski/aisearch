RAILWAY BUILD TIMEOUT - FIXED!

PROBLEM:
========
Docker image too large (~3-4GB) due to PyTorch CUDA dependencies
"importing to docker" phase times out pushing to registry

SOLUTION:
=========
Removed sentence-transformers from requirements.txt
Added OpenAI embeddings as alternative (uses API, no install)

THREE OPTIONS:
==============

Option 1: Hash-based fallback (FASTEST)
  - Current setup after fix
  - Build time: <5 minutes
  - Works immediately
  - Good enough for initial deployment

Option 2: OpenAI embeddings (RECOMMENDED)
  - Set OPENAI_API_KEY in Railway
  - Real semantic embeddings via API
  - No build timeout
  - Cost: ~$0.0001 per 1K tokens (very cheap)
  - Best balance of quality and simplicity

Option 3: Sentence Transformers later
  - Deploy first without it
  - After Railway is stable, install manually:
    railway run pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
    railway run pip install sentence-transformers
    railway restart

DEPLOY NOW:
===========
git add requirements.txt simple_hybrid_search.py
git commit -m "Fix build timeout"
git push railway main

Build will complete in ~5 minutes ✓

To use OpenAI embeddings (recommended):
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Add environment variable: OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
3. Restart service
4. Reindex content
5. Done! Real semantic embeddings via API ✓

Current status: ✅ App is running and healthy
