# ⚠️ VERSION 2.8.7 - Debug Version

## 🔍 **YOUR ISSUE**

> "its showing 10 results, then when i click load more its shows 10 more. and then the button dont show"

**Behavior:**
- ✅ Page 1: 10 results + button
- ✅ Page 2: 10 more results (click works!)
- ❌ Page 3: Button disappears

---

## 🐛 **POSSIBLE CAUSES**

### **Most Likely:**
**Your search only has 20 results total!**
- Page 1: Shows results 1-10 (10 left) → Button shows ✓
- Page 2: Shows results 11-20 (0 left) → Button hides ✓ (CORRECT!)

This would be **expected behavior**, not a bug!

### **Other Possibilities:**
1. Backend returning wrong `has_more` value
2. Button visibility logic bug
3. Caching issue

---

## ✅ **WHAT I DID IN 2.8.7**

Added **comprehensive debugging** to track exactly what's happening:

```javascript
// Now you'll see:
Hybrid Search: Load more response: {...}
Hybrid Search: Pagination data: {has_more: true/false, total_results: XX}
Hybrid Search: Has more? true or false

=== updateLoadMoreButton called ===
Has more: true or false
ACTION: Showing/Hiding Load More button
✓ Load More button shown  OR  ✗ Load More button hidden
```

## 📝 **WHAT I NEED FROM YOU**

1. **Upload version 2.8.7:**
   - `hybrid-search.php`
   - `FrontendManager.php`

2. **Clear all caches**

3. **Do this test:**
   - Search for something with MANY results (30+)
   - Click "Load More" twice
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - **Copy ALL console logs**
   - Send them to me

---

## 🎯 **WHAT THE LOGS WILL TELL US**

The logs will show:

1. **Total results:** `total_results: 20` or `total_results: 50`
2. **Has more after page 2:** `has_more: true` or `false`
3. **Why button hides:** Expected behavior vs bug

Then I can fix the exact issue!

## 📊 **QUICK TEST**

Try searching for different queries:
- ✅ "energy" - Should have 30+ results
- ✅ "environmental" - Should have 40+ results
- ✅ "waste" - Should have 25+ results

If ALL searches stop after 20 results → Backend issue
If SOME searches work → Depends on total results (expected!)
