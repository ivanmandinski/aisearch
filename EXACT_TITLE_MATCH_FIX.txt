‚≠ê EXACT TITLE MATCH BOOSTING - ADDED!

üêõ THE PROBLEM:
===============
User searches: "James Walsh"
Post exists with EXACT title: "James Walsh"
Expected position: #1 
Actual position: #4 ‚ùå

WHY THIS HAPPENED:
------------------
The search system had NO title match boosting logic!

Search flow was:
1. TF-IDF retrieval (content-based, not title-focused)
2. AI reranking (looks at full content, might rank content-heavy posts higher)
3. Post type priority (might push other types above)
4. Result: Exact title match buried at position #4

‚ùå A post titled "About Environmental Projects" with "James Walsh" mentioned 
   many times in the content could score HIGHER than the "James Walsh" post!

‚úÖ THE FIX:
===========

Added NEW STEP #1: Exact Title Match Boosting
----------------------------------------------
Now search flow is:

1. **EXACT TITLE MATCH BOOST** ‚≠ê NEW!
   - "James Walsh" search finds "James Walsh" title ‚Üí INSTANT #1
   - Score boosted to 1.0 (maximum)
   - Guaranteed top position

2. **PARTIAL TITLE MATCH BOOST** ‚ö° NEW!
   - "James Walsh Environmental" finds "James Walsh" title
   - Score boosted by 50% 
   - High priority

3. AI Reranking (for content-based ranking)
4. Post Type Priority (for grouping)
5. Filters (type, date)

üéØ HOW IT WORKS:
================

EXACT MATCH (100% boost):
-------------------------
Search: "James Walsh"
Title:  "James Walsh"
Result: ‚≠ê Position #1, Score 1.0

PARTIAL MATCH (50% boost):
--------------------------
Search: "environmental consulting"
Title:  "Environmental Consulting Services"
Result: ‚ö° Boosted significantly

CONTENT MATCH (normal):
----------------------
Search: "environmental"
Title:  "About Our Team"
Content: "...environmental projects..."
Result: Normal AI ranking

üìã FEATURES ADDED:
==================

1. boostExactTitleMatches()
   - Separates results into 3 groups:
     * Exact title matches (score 1.0)
     * Partial title matches (score +50%)
     * Other results (unchanged)
   - Returns merged array: exact ‚Üí partial ‚Üí others

2. titleContainsAllWords()
   - Smart word matching
   - Ignores stop words (the, a, an, and, or, etc.)
   - Only checks significant words (3+ characters)
   - Example: "James Walsh" checks both "james" and "walsh"

3. Detailed Logging
   - "‚≠ê EXACT TITLE MATCH" logged for exact matches
   - "‚ö° PARTIAL TITLE MATCH" logged for partial matches
   - Summary: "X exact, Y partial, Z other"

üîç EXAMPLES:
============

Example 1: Name Search
----------------------
Search: "James Walsh"
Results BEFORE fix:
  1. Environmental Projects (content mentions James Walsh 10x)
  2. About Our Team (James Walsh is author)
  3. Services (James Walsh in bio)
  4. James Walsh ‚Üê Should be #1!

Results AFTER fix:
  1. James Walsh ‚≠ê EXACT MATCH
  2. Environmental Projects
  3. About Our Team
  4. Services

Example 2: Professional Search
-------------------------------
Search: "Sarah Johnson Environmental Engineer"
Results AFTER fix:
  1. Sarah Johnson ‚≠ê EXACT MATCH (if exists)
  2. Sarah Johnson - Environmental Engineer ‚ö° PARTIAL MATCH
  3. Environmental Engineering Services (content match)
  4. About Sarah Johnson (content match)

Example 3: Service Search
-------------------------
Search: "environmental consulting"
Results AFTER fix:
  1. Environmental Consulting ‚≠ê EXACT MATCH
  2. Environmental Consulting Services ‚ö° PARTIAL MATCH
  3. Consulting for Environmental Projects (content match)
  4. About Our Services (content match)

üöÄ WHAT TO DO:
==============

1. Upload updated wordpress-plugin/includes/AJAX/AJAXManager.php

2. Test with "James Walsh" search:
   - Should now appear at position #1
   - Check debug.log for: "‚≠ê EXACT TITLE MATCH"

3. Test with other name searches:
   - Any SCS professional name
   - Should always be #1 if exact title exists

4. Check WordPress debug.log:
   tail -f wp-content/debug.log | grep "TITLE MATCH"

üìä EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
=====================

For Name Searches (e.g. "James Walsh"):
‚úì Exact title match ALWAYS #1
‚úì Partial matches ranked high (#2-5)
‚úì Content mentions ranked lower (#6+)

For Service Searches (e.g. "environmental consulting"):
‚úì Exact service title first
‚úì Similar service titles next  
‚úì Related content after

For General Searches (e.g. "water quality"):
‚úì AI ranking determines order
‚úì But exact title "Water Quality" still #1 if exists

üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS:
=====================

File Modified:
--------------
wordpress-plugin/includes/AJAX/AJAXManager.php

Functions Added:
----------------
- boostExactTitleMatches($query, $results) - Line 628-684
- titleContainsAllWords($title, $query) - Line 694-716

Integration Point:
------------------
Line 339: Applied BEFORE AI reranking and post type priority
This ensures exact matches can't be demoted by other logic

Scoring Logic:
--------------
- Exact match: score = 1.0 (maximum)
- Partial match: score = min(0.95, original * 1.5)
- Other: score unchanged

Stop Words Filtered:
--------------------
'the', 'a', 'an', 'and', 'or', 'but', 'in', 'on', 'at', 'to', 'for'

Word Length Requirement:
------------------------
Only words with 3+ characters are considered significant
(Prevents matching on "a", "of", "to", etc.)

üí° WHY THIS MATTERS:
====================

For SCS Engineers website:
‚úì Professional profiles always found by name
‚úì Service pages found by exact service name
‚úì Better user experience for specific searches
‚úì Reduces frustration when exact match exists

For User Experience:
‚úì Intuitive results (exact match = #1)
‚úì Predictable behavior
‚úì Faster finding what you need

üéâ RESULT:
