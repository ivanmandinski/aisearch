- [ ] `wordpress-plugin/assets/js/hybrid-search.js` (debugging + pagination)

---

## 🧹 Clear Caches

- [ ] Clear WordPress cache (WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, etc.)
- [ ] Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
- [ ] Clear server cache (if applicable)

---

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### **1. Basic Pagination Test**
- [ ] Search for something with 30+ results (e.g., "agriculture", "energy")
- [ ] Page 1: Verify shows exactly 10 results
- [ ] Click "Load More"
- [ ] Page 2: Verify shows next 10 results (11-20)
- [ ] Click "Load More"
- [ ] Page 3: Verify shows next 10 results (21-30) **NOT duplicates!**
- [ ] Continue clicking until last page
- [ ] Verify "Load More" button disappears
- [ ] Verify "No more results" message appears

### **2. Console Verification**
Open browser console (F12) and verify:

**Should SEE:**
- [ ] ✅ "Infinite scroll disabled (using hybrid-search.js pagination)"
- [ ] ✅ "Cached X results for client-side pagination"
- [ ] ✅ "Using cached results for pagination (page 2)"
- [ ] ✅ "Using cached results for pagination (page 3)"
- [ ] ✅ "=== CACHE PAGINATION ===" logs
- [ ] ✅ "=== APPEND RESULTS ===" logs

**Should NOT see:**
- [ ] ❌ "Infinite scroll triggered"
- [ ] ❌ "Loading more results for offset: 10" (multiple times)
- [ ] ❌ Any JavaScript errors

### **3. Performance Check**
- [ ] Page 1: Has loading spinner (API call)
- [ ] Page 2: Instant load (no spinner) - from cache
- [ ] Page 3: Instant load (no spinner) - from cache
- [ ] Browser Network tab shows only 1 API call (not 3+)

### **4. Edge Cases**
- [ ] Search with <10 results: No "Load More" button
- [ ] Search with exactly 10 results: No "Load More" button
- [ ] Search with 11 results: "Load More" appears once, then disappears
- [ ] New search: Cache clears, fresh API call made

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

All of these must be TRUE:
- [ ] No duplicate results on any page
- [ ] Pagination works smoothly (no errors)
- [ ] Pages 2+ load instantly (cached)
- [ ] "Load More" shows/hides correctly
- [ ] Console logs are clean (no "infinite scroll triggered")
- [ ] Only 1 API call per search (not 3+)
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console

---

## 🐛 If Issues Found

### **Still seeing duplicates?**
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+F5)
2. Check if files uploaded correctly
3. Verify FrontendManager.php line 1799 says "return;" 
4. Check console for "Infinite scroll triggered" (shouldn't appear)

### **"Load More" not working?**
1. Check console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify hybrid-search.js uploaded correctly
3. Check if `hybridSearch.maxResults` is set (should be 10)

### **No results showing?**
1. Check API connection in WordPress admin
2. Verify Railway API is running
3. Check WordPress error logs
