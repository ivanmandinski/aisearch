# Query Intent Detection - IMPLEMENTED âœ…

## What Was Implemented

Query Intent Detection automatically detects **what users are looking for** and adjusts search behavior accordingly.

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Intent Detection

The system analyzes query patterns to determine intent:

```python
Query: "James Walsh"
Pattern: "FirstName LastName" (2 words, both capitalized, 3+ chars each)
Detected Intent: person_name

Query: "cloud services"  
Pattern: Contains "services" keyword
Detected Intent: service

Query: "how to improve compliance"
Pattern: Starts with "how"
Detected Intent: howto

Query: "contact us"
Pattern: Contains "contact" keyword
Detected Intent: navigational
```

### Step 2: Intent-Based Instructions

Automatically generates AI instructions based on intent:

#### Person Name Intent
```
User is searching for a specific person: "James Walsh".

PRIORITY:
1. SCS Professionals profiles where the person's full name appears in the title
2. Biographical content about this specific person
3. Press releases, announcements, or news about this person

RULES:
- Only show results about THIS specific person
- Boost exact name matches in titles
- Do NOT include general articles unless they're specifically about this person
```

#### Service Intent
```
User is looking for services or solutions related to: "cloud services".

PRIORITY:
1. Service description pages that match the query
2. Solution offerings and capabilities
3. Service-specific landing pages

RULES:
- Prioritize actionable, practical service information
- Show what services are available
- Avoid general informational content unless highly relevant
```

#### How-To Intent
```
User needs actionable guidance on: "how to improve compliance".

PRIORITY:
1. Step-by-step guides and tutorials
2. Instructional content with actionable steps
3. "How to" articles with practical advice

RULES:
- Prioritize content with numbered steps or clear instructions
- Look for practical, actionable advice
- Skip theoretical content unless no practical guides exist
```

### Step 3: Intent-Based Post Type Priority

Automatically applies the right priority order:

| Intent | Applied Priority | Why |
|--------|------------------|-----|
| `person_name` | `['scs-professionals', 'page', 'post']` | People in professionals first |
| `service` | `['page', 'scs-services', 'post']` | Service pages most important |
| `howto` | `['post', 'page', 'scs-professionals']` | Articles/guides most relevant |
| `navigational` | User's custom priority | Keep default behavior |
| `transactional` | User's custom priority | Keep default behavior |
| `general` | User's custom priority | Use admin settings |

## Real Examples

### Example 1: "James Walsh"

```python
Query: "James Walsh"
Detected Intent: person_name

Applied AI Instructions:
"User is searching for a specific person. Prioritize SCS Professionals profiles..."

Applied Post Type Priority:
['scs-professionals', 'page', 'post', 'attachment']

Result:
âœ… #1: James Walsh SCS Professional profile
âœ… #2: James Walsh press releases (if any)
âœ… #3: Articles mentioning James Walsh
```

### Example 2: "cloud services"

```python
Query: "cloud services"
Detected Intent: service

Applied AI Instructions:
"User is looking for services. Prioritize service description pages..."

Applied Post Type Priority:
['page', 'scs-services', 'post']

Result:
âœ… #1: Cloud Services page
âœ… #2: Service offering pages
âœ… #3: Articles about cloud services
```

### Example 3: "how to improve environmental compliance"

```python
Query: "how to improve environmental compliance"
Detected Intent: howto

Applied AI Instructions:
"User needs actionable guidance. Prioritize step-by-step guides..."

Applied Post Type Priority:
['post', 'page', 'scs-professionals']

Result:
âœ… #1: Step-by-step compliance guide
âœ… #2: How-to article
âœ… #3: Tutorial content
```

## Integration with Existing Features

### 1. Works with User's Custom Instructions

```python
# User's custom instructions:
"Craft clever responses that make users happy"

# Combined with intent-based instructions:
"Craft clever responses that make users happy

User is searching for a specific person: 'James Walsh'.
PRIORITY: SCS Professionals profiles..."
```

### 2. Works with Post Type Priority

```python
# If user has custom priority: ['page', 'post']
# But intent is 'person_name'
# System uses: ['scs-professionals', 'page', 'post']
# (Intent-based priority overrides when no user priority)
```

### 3. Works with AI Reranking

```python
# Intent instructions added to AI reranking
AI sees:
1. User's custom instructions
2. Intent-based instructions (e.g., "Prioritize SCS Professionals")
3. Query text
4. Search results

# AI applies ALL instructions together
```

## Supported Intents

### 1. person_name
- **Pattern**: "FirstName LastName" (both capitalized, 3+ chars each)
- **Examples**: "James Walsh", "Sarah Johnson"
- **Behavior**: Shows professional profiles first

### 2. service
- **Pattern**: Contains "service", "services", "solutions", "consulting", etc.
- **Examples**: "cloud services", "environmental consulting"
- **Behavior**: Shows service pages first

### 3. howto
- **Pattern**: Starts with "how", "what", "why", "when", "where"
- **Examples**: "how to improve compliance", "what is environmental monitoring"
- **Behavior**: Shows guides and tutorials first

### 4. navigational
- **Pattern**: Contains "contact", "about", "team", "locations", etc.
- **Examples**: "contact us", "our team", "office locations"
- **Behavior**: Shows specific pages

### 5. transactional
- **Pattern**: Contains "buy", "download", "purchase", "order", etc.
- **Examples**: "download brochure", "buy service"
- **Behavior**: Shows action pages

### 6. general
- **Pattern**: Everything else
- **Behavior**: Uses user's custom priority

## Testing

Test with these queries:

1. **Person Search**: "James Walsh"
   - Expected: SCS Professionals profile #1

2. **Service Search**: "cloud services"
   - Expected: Service pages first

3. **How-To**: "how to improve environmental compliance"
   - Expected: Step-by-step guides first

4. **Navigation**: "contact us"
   - Expected: Contact page #1

5. **General**: "environmental"
   - Expected: Uses your custom priority

## Benefits

### Before Intent Detection
- Search for "James Walsh" â†’ Shows articles, press releases, anything
- Search for "services" â†’ Shows all content with "services"
- Generic AI behavior

### After Intent Detection
- Search for "James Walsh" â†’ Shows James Walsh profile #1 âœ…
- Search for "cloud services" â†’ Shows service pages first âœ…
- Intent-aware AI behavior âœ…
- Automatically applies right priority âœ…

## Next Steps

The implementation is ready! After deployment:

1. **Test with "James Walsh"**
   - Should detect `person_name` intent
   - Should prioritize SCS Professionals
   - Should NOT add external context (e.g., "musician")

2. **Test with "cloud services"**
   - Should detect `service` intent
   - Should show service pages first

3. **Check Logs**
   - Look for: `ðŸŽ¯ Query intent detected: person_name`
   - Look for: `Person search: Prioritizing SCS Professionals`

4. **Monitor Search Results**
   - Results should be more specific
   - Right content type should appear first
   - AI answers should be more relevant

---

## Summary

**Query Intent Detection** makes search **smarter** by:
1. Understanding what users are looking for
2. Applying the right search strategy
3. Prioritizing the right content types
4. Making search results more specific and relevant

**Status**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED AND READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
