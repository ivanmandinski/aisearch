# Why `indexed_vectors: 0` and How to Fix It

## The Problem

You're seeing `indexed_vectors: 0` in stats, even though you have 2836 documents stored.

## What `indexed_vectors` Actually Means

Qdrant has **two different metrics**:

1. **`vectors_count`**: Total number of vectors STORED in Qdrant
2. **`indexed_vectors_count`**: How many vectors are INDEXED in the HNSW structure for fast search

The old code was reading `indexed_vectors_count`, which can be 0 even when vectors ARE stored (because Qdrant may defer indexing until needed).

## The Fix

I updated `simple_hybrid_search.py` line 727 to:

```python
# Use vectors_count as the primary metric (total vectors stored)
vectors_count = collection_info.get('vectors_count', 0)
indexed_vectors_count = collection_info.get('indexed_vectors_count', 0)

# If indexed_vectors_count is 0 but we have vectors, it means indexing is deferred
# Still show the actual vector count
vectors_stored = vectors_count if vectors_count > 0 else indexed_vectors_count
```

## Commits Ready to Deploy

1. `9916cbf` - Fix: Use vectors_count for stats display
2. `c069263` - Add content-based alternative query generation
3. `5ba664c` - Fix: Integer IDs for Qdrant
4. `77d1efd` - Use existing qdrant_manager
5. `408c3b6` - VectorParams access pattern fix

## What to Do

Deploy these commits to Railway (push to GitHub or upload files), then check stats again. You should see:

```json
{
  "indexed_vectors": 2836,  // ✅ Should show your actual vector count!
  "total_documents": 2836
}
```

## Is Your Search Actually Working?

**Yes!** Your search is already working. The fact that:
- `total_documents: 2836` ✅
- `status: green` ✅
- Search returns results ✅

Means your vectors ARE stored and searchable. The `indexed_vectors: 0` was just a reporting issue.
