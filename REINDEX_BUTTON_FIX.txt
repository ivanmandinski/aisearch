✅ REINDEX BUTTON FIXED!

🐛 PROBLEM:
===========
When clicking "Reindex Content", the button showed malformed HTML:
<button>
    <span class="dashicons dashicons-update">
        <span class="dashicons dashicons-update-alt"></span> Reindexing...
    </span>
    Reindex Content
</button>

This happened because:
❌ JavaScript used event.target which could be the <span> inside the button
❌ When user clicked the span, innerHTML was set on the span, not the button
❌ This created nested/corrupted HTML structure

🔧 FIXES APPLIED:
=================

1. Fixed JavaScript function (AdminManager.php line 399-456)
   ✓ Now uses event.target.closest('button') to always get the button
   ✓ Works correctly even if user clicks the icon or text inside
   ✓ Properly saves and restores button HTML

2. Enhanced button states with visual feedback:
   ✓ Loading: "🔄 Reindexing..." (spinning icon)
   ✓ Success: "✓ Success!" (green checkmark, auto-restores after 2s)
   ✓ Error: "⚠ Error" (warning icon, auto-restores after 2s)

3. Added spinning animation (AdminManager.php line 392-399)
   ✓ Smooth rotation animation for loading state
   ✓ Professional visual feedback

4. Added disabled button styling
   ✓ Button becomes semi-transparent when disabled
   ✓ Cursor changes to "not-allowed"

🎯 HOW IT WORKS NOW:
====================

1. User clicks "Reindex Content"
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. Button changes to: 🔄 Reindexing... (spinning)
4. Button disabled during process
5. On success: Shows ✓ Success! for 2 seconds
6. On error: Shows ⚠ Error for 2 seconds
7. Button automatically restores to original state

📦 WHAT TO DO:
==============

1. Upload updated wordpress-plugin/includes/Admin/AdminManager.php
2. Go to WordPress Admin → Hybrid Search → Dashboard
3. Click "Reindex Content"
4. Should now work smoothly with proper visual states!

🔍 DEBUGGING:
=============

If reindex still fails (not the button itself):
- Check WordPress debug.log for errors
- Verify API URL is configured correctly
- Check Railway API is accessible
- Look at browser console for AJAX errors

The button UI will now work correctly regardless!
