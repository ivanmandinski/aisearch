║                        ANALYTICS & AI STATS - FIXED ✓                        ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

📋 REPORTED ISSUES:
==================
1. hybrid-search-analytics not working at all
2. AI Reranking Performance not updating

🔍 ROOT CAUSES FOUND:
=====================

ISSUE #1: Analytics Not Working
--------------------------------
❌ Column name mismatch in DashboardWidget.php:
   - Code was using: created_at, response_time, result_count
   - Database has: timestamp, time_taken, has_results

❌ No table existence check - fails silently if table missing

ISSUE #2: AI Stats Not Updating  
--------------------------------
❌ Metadata check too rigid:
   - Only checked: result['metadata']['ai_reranking_used']
   - Railway API might return it in nested location
   - Or might not return the flag at all

✅ FIXES APPLIED:
=================

1. Fixed DashboardWidget.php (wordpress-plugin/includes/Admin/DashboardWidget.php)
   ✓ Changed all queries to use correct column names:
     - created_at → timestamp
     - response_time → time_taken  
     - result_count → has_results
   ✓ Added table existence check before queries
   ✓ Returns empty stats gracefully if table missing

2. Fixed AJAXManager.php (wordpress-plugin/includes/AJAX/AJAXManager.php)
   ✓ Enhanced AI metadata detection:
     - Checks metadata['ai_reranking_used'] (root level)
     - Checks metadata['raw_metadata']['ai_reranking_used'] (nested)
     - Falls back gracefully if not found
   ✓ Added detailed logging for debugging

3. Added SCS Brand Theme Scoping (wordpress-plugin/assets/css/scs-brand-theme.css)
   ✓ ALL brand colors now scoped to .hybrid-search-container
   ✓ No longer affects site theme
   ✓ Only applies to hybrid search shortcode component

4. Created Diagnostic Tool (NEW FILE)
   wordpress-plugin/includes/Admin/DiagnosticTool.php
   
   ✓ Checks analytics table exists
   ✓ Verifies all required columns  
   ✓ Tests database insert capability
   ✓ Checks AI stats option configured
   ✓ Validates API URL
   ✓ Confirms AI reranking enabled
   ✓ Auto-creates missing tables/options
   ✓ Provides detailed diagnostic report

5. Added Diagnostics Page to WordPress Admin
   wordpress-plugin/includes/Admin/AdminManager.php
   
   ✓ New menu item: Hybrid Search > Diagnostics
   ✓ One-click diagnostic runner
   ✓ Visual report with pass/fail indicators
   ✓ Shows applied fixes automatically
   ✓ Helps troubleshoot analytics/AI issues

🚀 HOW TO USE:
==============

1. UPLOAD UPDATED FILES:
   ────────────────────────
   Upload the wordpress-plugin folder to WordPress

2. GO TO DIAGNOSTICS PAGE:
   ────────────────────────
   WordPress Admin → Hybrid Search → Diagnostics

3. RUN DIAGNOSTICS:
   ────────────────────────
   Click "▶️ Run Full Diagnostics"

4. REVIEW REPORT:
   ────────────────────────
   - ✅ Green = Working correctly
   - ❌ Red = Issue found (will auto-fix if possible)
   - ⚠️ Yellow = Warning

5. CHECK ANALYTICS:
   ────────────────────────
   - Perform a few test searches
   - Go to Hybrid Search → Dashboard
   - Analytics should now populate
   - AI stats should now update after searches

📊 WHAT GETS TRACKED NOW:
==========================

Analytics Tracking:
-------------------
✓ Every search query
✓ Number of results
✓ Response time  
✓ Device type (mobile/desktop)
✓ Browser used
✓ Session tracking
✓ Zero-result queries

AI Reranking Stats:
-------------------
✓ Total AI-powered searches
✓ Average AI response time
✓ Total AI cost (if available from Railway)
✓ Last updated timestamp

🐛 DEBUGGING:
=============

If analytics still not working:
1. Run diagnostics (Hybrid Search → Diagnostics)
2. Check WordPress debug.log for errors:
   grep "ANALYTICS" wp-content/debug.log
   grep "Hybrid Search" wp-content/debug.log

3. Verify table exists:
   In phpMyAdmin, look for: wp_hybrid_search_analytics

4. Check API connection:
   Hybrid Search → Settings → Test API Connection

If AI stats not updating:
1. Verify AI reranking enabled (Settings)
2. Check Railway logs for AI reranking output
3. Perform a test search and check:
   WordPress debug.log for "AI reranking WAS used"

📌 COLUMN MAPPINGS (FIXED):
============================

Before (WRONG):           After (CORRECT):
─────────────────         ────────────────
created_at            →   timestamp
response_time         →   time_taken
result_count          →   has_results

🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
=====================

✓ Dashboard widget shows real-time stats
✓ Analytics page populates with search data
✓ AI Reranking Performance updates after each AI-powered search
✓ Top queries list appears
✓ Zero-result queries tracked
✓ Device/browser stats visible

💡 NEXT STEPS:
==============

1. Upload updated plugin files
2. Run diagnostics to verify everything works
3. Perform 5-10 test searches with different queries
4. Check Dashboard widget for updated numbers
5. View Analytics page for detailed breakdown

If diagnostics show "✅ All Systems Healthy" but analytics still 
not updating, it means:
- Table structure is correct
- Permissions are good
- But searches might not be tracked yet

Solution: Perform fresh searches AFTER uploading fixes!
