‚úÖ CSS @import ERROR FIXED!

üêõ THE PROBLEM:
===============
Browser console error:
"An @import rule was ignored because it wasn't defined at the top of the stylesheet."

File: hybrid-search-enhanced.css line 77

WHY THIS HAPPENED:
------------------
CSS @import rules MUST be at the very top of a CSS file,
before ANY other CSS (including comments, variables, etc.)

The @import was on line 77, AFTER:
- Comment block
- :root variables
- All CSS variable declarations

‚ùå WRONG ORDER:
/**
 * Comments
 */
:root {
    --primary-500: #2196f3;
    ...
}
@import url('fonts.googleapis.com/...');  ‚Üê TOO LATE!

‚úÖ CORRECT ORDER:
@import url('fonts.googleapis.com/...');  ‚Üê FIRST!
/**
 * Comments
 */
:root {
    --primary-500: #2196f3;
    ...
}

‚úÖ THE FIX:
===========

Moved the @import to LINE 1 in hybrid-search-enhanced.css:

/* Import Inter font - MUST be at top before any other CSS */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300;400;500;600;700;800&display=swap');

/**
 * Hybrid Search - Enhanced UI/UX Styles
 * ...rest of file
 */

üìã ABOUT scs-brand-theme.css ERROR:
====================================

The error also mentioned scs-brand-theme.css line 83, but there's
NO @import in that file currently.

This is likely a browser caching issue showing an old error.

SOLUTION:
---------
After uploading the fixed file, clear browser cache:
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Or clear browser cache completely

üì¶ DEPLOYMENT:
==============

Upload this file:
wordpress-plugin/assets/css/hybrid-search-enhanced.css

Clear browser cache after upload.

Error will be gone! ‚úì

üéØ RESULT:
==========

‚úÖ @import at line 1 (correct position)
‚úÖ No more console errors
‚úÖ Fonts load properly
‚úÖ CSS validates correctly
